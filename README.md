# AFANG UDUAK - Data Analysis Portfolio 

## About

Hello there! I'm Uduak Afang. Thrilled to have you visit my portfolio.
I am a data analyst, eager to make my mark in the world of data-driven insights. I am a highly motivated individual with a strong desire to embark on a career in this exciting field. I am passionate about using data to uncover valuable insights and make informed decisions. 
  My journey into the world of data analysis began in 2021 when I realized my deep curiosity about data and how data can drive meaningful outcomes. I have taken the initiative to independently learn critical concepts, tools, and techniques through online courses, tutorials, and personal projects.
		These experiences have provided me with a solid foundation in areas such as Data Collection, Data Cleaning, and Data Visualization.
		In addition to my passion for data analysis, I bring Critical thinking, Problem-solving, and Communication skills, which are vital in analyzing data and effectively communicating insights to drive business decisions.<p>

## Portfolio Projects
In this section, I will list data analytics projects briefly describing the technology stack used to solve cases.

### Analyzing Flipkart fashion products dataset
This dataset contained 30,000 rows of  fashion product data on Flipkart. The data was in a JSON file, so this had to be parsed into a Table in a RDBMS. Data was cleaned and then analyzed to find trends and descriptive qualities of the dataset
All of these were done using SQL, MSSQL to be exact.
Steps were divided into 2 phases: 
Phase 1: Parsing the JSON data and cleaning the data
Phase 2: Analysing and finding trends
**Code** ['Folder'](https://github.com/UduakAfang/Portfolio/tree/main/Flipkart%20data%20analysis)
**Skills:** Data transformation, data cleaning, analysis.  
**Technology:** SQL(MSSQL)

### Customer Churn Analysis
Examining data of Existing and Attrited bank customers. The dataset consisted of 10,127 rows: 8500 existing customers and 1627 attrited customers.
The task was to examine the characteristics of the churned customers and use this to predict existing customers that are likely to churn. 
**Code**['Sql Scripts'](https://github.com/UduakAfang/Portfolio/blob/main/Analysis%20of%20churned%20bank%20customers.ipynb)
**Skills:** data cleaning, analysis.  
**Technology:** SQL(MSSQL)

### HCAHPS Survey Analysis
Analyzing 9 years of Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems surveys.
Data consisted of 7 tables. 2 fact Tables in National and State results with other tables providing more information.
The task was to evaluate whether the HCAHPS survey has been successful in accomplishing this goal by answering questions like these:
Have hospitals' HCAHPS scores improved over the past 9 years?
Are there any specific areas where hospitals have made more progress than others?
Are there any major areas of opportunity remaining?
What recommendations can you make to hospitals to help them further improve the patient experience?

**Code** ['HCAHPS Survey code'](https://github.com/UduakAfang/Portfolio/blob/main/Maven%20Healthcare%20Challenge/SQL%20Notebook%20Healthcare%20Challenge.ipynb)
**Dashboard** ['HCAHPS Dashboard'](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/uduak.afang/viz/MavenHealthCareChallenge_16917906652240/HCAHPSPatientDashboard2)
**Skills:** Joining, Analysis, Visualization.  
**Technology:** SQL(MSSQL), Tableau

### Demsco Travel and Tours Performance Analysis
**Code:** ['demscoperformancequery.sql'](https://github.com/UduakAfang/Portfolio/blob/main/demscoperformancequery.sql)
**Presentation:** [`demscoperformanceanalysis.pdf`](https://github.com/UduakAfang/Portfolio/blob/main/Demsco%20Performance%20Analysis%20Slide.pdf)
**Description:** This dataset contained about 1200 records as of 2021. This company had records in hard copy form so I entered them manually into an Excel spreadsheet.
Each row showed the Ticket number, PNR number, Customer Name, Start and End location, Booking Date, Airline, Type of flight (International or Domestic), Class of Flight, Date of Travel, Return Date, Price, and Charges. 
**Skills:** data entry, cleaning, analysis, visualization.  
**Technology:** Excel, SQL(Mysql), PowerBI


### Exploratory Data Analysis on Music x Mental Health Survey
**Code:** ['musicxmentalhealth-eda.sql'](https://github.com/UduakAfang/Portfolio/blob/main/Music%20Therapy%20Query.sql)
**Visualization:**['musicxmentalhealth.pdf'](https://github.com/UduakAfang/Portfolio/blob/main/Music%26Mental%20Health%20EDA%20Visualization.pdf)
**Description:** This dataset contained 736 records of survey answers. The aim was to identify what if any, correlations exist between an individual's music taste and their self-reported mental health. These findings could contribute to a more informed application of MT or simply provide interesting sights about the mind. 
**Skills:** Data cleaning, analysis, visualization.  
**Technology:** SQL(Mssql), PowerBI, PowerBI(python scripts)
