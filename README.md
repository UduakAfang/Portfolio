# AFANG UDUAK - Data Analysis Portfolio 

## About

Hello there! I'm Uduak Afang, and I'm thrilled to have you visit my portfolio.
I am an aspiring and passionate data analyst, eager to make my mark in the world of data-driven insights. While I may not have a formal background in data analysis, I am a highly motivated individual with a strong desire to embark on a career in this exciting field. I am passionate about using data to uncover valuable insights and make informed decisions. 
  My journey into the world of data analysis began in 2021 when I realized my deep curiosity about data and how data can drive meaningful outcomes. I have taken the initiative to independently learn critical concepts, tools, and techniques through online courses, tutorials, and personal projects.
		These experiences have provided me with a solid foundation in areas such as Data Collection, Data Cleaning, and Data Visualization.
		In addition to my passion for data analysis, I bring Critical thinking, Problem-solving, and Communication skills, which are vital in analyzing data and effectively communicating insights to drive business decisions.<p>

## Portfolio Projects
In this section, I will list data analytics projects briefly describing the technology stack used to solve cases.

### Demsco Travel and Tours Performance Analysis
**Code:** ['demscoperformancequery.sql'](https://github.com/UduakAfang/Portfolio/blob/main/demscoperformancequery.sql)
**Presentation:** [`demscoperformanceanalysis.pdf`](https://github.com/UduakAfang/Portfolio/blob/main/Demsco%20Performance%20Analysis%20Slide.pdf)
**Description:** This dataset contained about 1200 records as of 2021. This company had records in hard copy form so I entered them manually into an Excel spreadsheet.
Each row showed the Ticket number, PNR number, Customer Name, Start and End location, Booking Date, Airline, Type of flight (International or Domestic), Class of Flight, Date of Travel, Return Date, Price, and Charges. 
**Skills:** data entry, cleaning, analysis, visualization.  
**Technology:** Excel, SQL(Mysql), PowerBI


### Exploratory Data Analysis on Music x Mental Health Survey
**Code:** ['musicxmentalhealth-eda.sql'](https://github.com/UduakAfang/Portfolio/blob/main/Music%20Therapy%20Query.sql)
**Visualization:**['musicxmentalhealth.pdf'](https://github.com/UduakAfang/Portfolio/blob/main/Music%26Mental%20Health%20EDA%20Visualization.pdf)
**Description:** This dataset contained 736 records of survey answers. The aim was to identify what if any, correlations exist between an individual's music taste and their self-reported mental health. These findings could contribute to a more informed application of MT or simply provide interesting sights about the mind. 
**Skills:** Data cleaning, analysis, visualization.  
**Technology:** SQL(Mssql), PowerBI, PowerBI(python scripts)
