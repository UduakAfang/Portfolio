# AFANG UDUAK - Data Analysis Portfolio 

## About

Hello there! I'm Uduak Afang, and I'm thrilled to have you visit my portfolio. I am an aspiring and passionate data analyst, eager to make my mark in the world of data-driven insights. While I may not have a formal background in data analysis, I am a highly motivated individual with a strong desire to embark on a career in this exciting field. I am passionate about using data to uncover valuable insights and make informed decisions. 
  My journey into the world of data analysis began in 2020. During the pandemic I realized my deep curiosity about data and how data can drive meaningful outcomes. I have taken the initiative to independently learn key concepts, tools, and techniques through online courses, tutorials, and personal projects.
		These experiences have provided me with a solid foundation in areas such as Data Collection, Data Cleaning and Data Visualizations.
		In addition to my passion for data analysis, I bring some skills which include Critical thinking, Problem-solving and Communication, which are vital in analyzing data and effectively communicating insights to drive business decisions.<p>
